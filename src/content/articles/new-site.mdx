import SideNote from '@components/SideNote.astro'

This site has gone through a few iterations. Django in 2010, Jekyll in 2013, and now Astro. At this point I've had more rewrites than articles. <SideNote>classic developer move</SideNote>

Each rewrite taught me something. Django was overkill for a personal site. Jekyll was simple but I eventually stopped updating it. This time I wanted to try Astro, and it was easier than expected. It ships zero JavaScript by default, so pages are fast. MDX lets me mix components with markdown. File-based routing means I just drop a file and it works. It doesn't get in the way.

Speaking of writing, I plan to do more of it. I've discovered the value of writing to organize my thoughts. Something about putting ideas into words forces clarity. Hopefully this version of the site will see more updates than the last one.

The code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/fasouto/fabiosouto.me) if you're curious.
