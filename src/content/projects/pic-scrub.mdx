This is the kind of project where you start small and end up in a rabbit hole. It began with wanting to understand how JPEG files actually work. It took more time than I'd like to admit.

PicScrub removes EXIF, GPS, and other metadata from images. It works through direct binary manipulation rather than re-encoding, so image quality stays intact. Supports JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, SVG, TIFF, HEIC, DNG, and RAW formats.

Available as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/picscrub) with zero dependencies, or use it directly at [picscrub.com](https://picscrub.com/). Everything runs in your browser, no uploads, no servers.

I also wrote a [guide on image formats](https://picscrub.com/guides/image-formats) while researching this.
