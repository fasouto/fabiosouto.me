[Apache ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html) is one of those projects I keep coming back to. It strikes a good balance between control and ease of use—powerful enough for complex visualizations, simple enough to get something working quickly.

I wanted to build a frontend where people could create charts visually and export them as PNG or JPG without writing code. ChartCreate does that. You can also render charts in XKCD style or with a hand-drawn look using rough.js.
