[Apache ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html) is one of those projects I keep coming back to. It strikes a good balance between control and ease of use—powerful enough for complex visualizations, simple enough to get something working quickly.

I wanted to build a frontend where people could create charts visually and export them as PNG or JPG without writing code. ChartCreate does that. You can also render charts in XKCD style or with a hand-drawn look using rough.js.

Choosing the right chart for your data isn't obvious. Bar chart? Line chart? Heatmap? I added a wizard that asks what you're trying to show, whether that's comparing items, tracking change over time, or finding patterns, and recommends the best chart type for the job.
