I built this as an experiment when Claude Code was first released. Small, self-contained utilities seemed like a good fit for AI-assisted development—each calculator lives in its own file with minimal context to manage.

I created a design system and started prompting. The results were mixed. I found myself switching back to manual coding more often than expected. Looking back, I was still learning how to work effectively with AI tools, and this was using an earlier model.

The project taught me a lot about where AI coding helps and where it doesn't. I haven't invested much time since—the calculator space is crowded and hard to differentiate.
