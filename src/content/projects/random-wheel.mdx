This started as a project to learn Vue.js in 2017. I built the first version with [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) and some of the wheels turned out to be surprisingly popular.

The site kept growing, so last year I rebuilt it in Nuxt. Users kept asking for features: private wheels, custom themes, search. I added them. Now it has AI mode too.
